# Data Analytics: Flight Traffic Patterns

Data Analytics & Visualizations Course Project: Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on US Flight Traffic

In this project, we examine the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on domestic flight traffic in the United States. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented negative impact on the aviation industry, leading to a sharp decline in the number of flights and passengers. To assess the extent and duration of the pandemic's impact on US flight traffic, We analyze the data from [Transtats](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/) library. In addition to highlighting annual trends in flight traffic, our findings provide insights into the effects of the pandemic on the aviation industry and can inform policy decisions aimed at mitigating the impact of future pandemics on air travel.
